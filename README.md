* Large format FDM 3d-printer
  * **310x310x350mm** build volume
  * Triple Belted Z axis motors for smooth and fast bed control
    * Capable of **true bed leveling** using 3 points of contact and maxwell kinematic mounts
    * **200mm/s bed movement** with 3 endstops to rough-home the printer to be used with [beacon probe](https://beacon3d.com/). This ensures the bed is level enough for any probe to work without high Z travel movements
* Crossed gantry design
   * 4 motors for X and Y movement, not just 2 like typical CoreXY designs
   * faster accelerations at quality, up to **40,000mm/s^2 (4Gs) acceleration**, regularly print at **20k accel**
   * Shorter belt paths for better positional accuracy and less "ringing"
